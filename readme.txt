Hi!

Thanks for purchasing the B7971 DUSTOFF IoT Board. This folder has documentation to include schematics, footprints, code for both the PICs and the 8266, and various photos and logos. If there is something you would like added, please message me at mahdi07@msn.com, and I will do my best to fulfill the request. 

Special thanks to Frantisek Skorsepa, who provided the HVPS design, and to Chris Barron* (aka fixitsan2) who developed the B7971 SmartSocket circuit. Without the support of these two, this project would have taken significantly longer to complete. 

v/r,

Mahdi
